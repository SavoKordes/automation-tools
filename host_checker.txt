Simple Network Connectivity Checker (Python)

Description
This script checks whether a host is reachable on a given TCP port.
It uses Python’s built-in socket library to attempt a connection with a user-defined timeout.

How it works
- The user enters a hostname (e.g. google.com or an IP address).
- The user enters a port number and a timeout value (in seconds).
- The script tries to open a TCP connection.
- Success or failure is printed to the terminal.
- The process repeats until the user types "done".

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (standard library only)

Usage
1. Run the script:
   python network_check.py
2. Enter a hostname when prompted.
3. Enter a port number (e.g. 80).
4. Enter a timeout value in seconds.
5. Type "done" to exit.

Notes
- Hostnames must be entered without protocols (use "google.com", not "http://google.com").
- Port and timeout must be numeric values.
- Connection failures are expected and handled safely.

Purpose
This script is meant as a learning exercise for:
- while loops
- input validation
- try/except error handling
- basic networking with sockets
